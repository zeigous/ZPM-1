ZPM-1 is an OoO procesor implementing the custom PAX ISA, its target clock speed when synthesized for the Cyclone IV FPGA (Likely for the DE0 Nano) is 80-100MHz, idealy 95+

The PAX ISA is a custom CISC ISA where instructions range from 3 Bytes to 13 Bytes, and each instruction can have up to 2 prefixes, with a maximum total instruction length of 16B. A Spreadsheet for the ISA Can be found at:
